Videoconference meeting of March 2  
A joint meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee 
and the Board of G overnors was held by videoconfer-
ence on March 2, 2020, at 7:30 p.m. to review develop-
ments related to the outbreak of the coronavirus and dis-
cuss steps that could be taken to provide support to the 
economy.  As background for the Committee’s discus-sion, the staff reviewed recent developments in financial markets and provided an assessment of the evolving risks to the economic outlook.  
The SOMA manager noted that since mid -February 
when concerns about the spread of the coronavirus be-
yond China had begun to i ntensify, global risk asset 
prices and sovereign yields had declined sharply.  U.S. 
and global equity indexes were lower than at the time of 
the Committee’s meeting in January and implied equity market volatility had risen to levels not seen since 2015.  The deterioration in risk sentiment had also been re-
flected in a significant widening in U.S. and European corporate credit spreads and in peripheral European spreads.  Amid the ongoing market volatility, issuance of investment -grade and high- yield corporat e bonds and of 
leveraged loans had generally dried up.  Money markets had been resilient during the broader financial market volatility; pricing and trading conditions in offshore U.S. dollar funding markets had also been stable.  Market 
functioning had remained orderly despite deterioration 
in liquidity conditions in Treasury, equity, and credit markets.  
Financial market participants’ views on the likely course 
of U.S. monetary policy had changed since the Commit-
tee’s January meeting.  The expected path of  the federal 
funds rate embedded in futures prices had shifted down significantly over the period.  Market commentary had 
interpreted Chair Powell’s February 28 statement as in-
dicating the FOMC was prepared to lower the target range for the federal funds r ate at or before the March 
meeting to support the achievement of the Committee’s 
maximum employment and price stability goals.  Expec-
tations for global monetary and fiscal easing had in-

 creased, with some market commentary noting the pos-
sibility of a coordi nated effort across central banks or 
fiscal authorities.  
The SOMA manager noted that the situation remained highly fluid with key risks, including those associated 
with funding for corporate borrowers, operational vul-
nerabilities associated with the transition to alternativ e 
work arrangements, and the potential for impaired mar-
ket functioning.  
The s taff then provided an update on current conditions 
and changes to the economic outlook since the FOMC’s January meeting.  Available indicators for China su g-
gested that the spread of the coronavirus had been asso-ciated with a collapse in economic activity during the 
first quarter, with spillovers to the global economy from 
the drop in Chinese demand and disruption of supply chains.  Although there were some tentative signs that the coronavirus in China was being contained and pro-
duction was beginning to resume, the outbreak of the 
virus in other foreign economies was weighing on con-sumer and business sentiment and depressing consump-tion in those countries.  All told, foreign economic ac-
tivity was expected to be significantly weaker during the 
first half of 2020 than the staff had anticipated at the 
time of the January FOMC meeting.  
The s taff noted that the spread of the virus was at an 
earlier stage in the United States and its effects were not yet visible in monthly economic indicators, although there had been some softening in daily sentiment in-dexes and travel -related transactions.  The outlook for 
real economic activity over the remainder of the year was highly uncertain and depended on the spread of the virus 
and the measures taken to contain it.  Scenarios involv-ing a greater spread of the coronavirus and more severe 
social -distancing actions would be associated with a 
greater shutdown of production and disruption of sup-
ply chains, larger negative effects on consumer and busi-ness sentiment, more significant increases in unemploy-
ment, and worsening financial conditions.  Reductions 
in demand, coupled with a stronger U.S. dollar and weaker commodity prices, were expected to put down-ward pressure on inflation, with the magnitude of the 
softening in core inflation depending on the severity of 
the situation.  
FOMC participants discussed the significant outbreaks of the coronavirus that had emerged recently in a few  
countries outside China and the likelihood that the virus would spread widely around the world, including in the United States.  While the economic outlook at the time of the Committee’s January meeting had been favorable, the potential spread of the virus and the measures needed to protect communities from it represented a 
material downside risk to the U.S. economy.  A forceful 
monetary policy action could provide a clear signal to the public that policymakers recognized the potential eco-nomic significance of the situation and were willing to 
move decisively to support the achievement of the Com-
mittee’s dual mandate goals and counter the recent tight-ening of financial conditions.  Although a reduction in the policy rate would not slow the spread of infecti on or 
remedy broken supply chains, it could help shore up the confidence of households, businesses, and financial mar-kets; ease financial strains of consumers and firms ; and 
provide meaningful support to the economy in the face 
of a large shock to demand.  Accordingly, participants 
supported a reduction of 50 basis points in the target 
range for the federal funds rate.  
On March 3, 2020, the Committee completed the vote 
to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:   
“Effective March 4, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to under-take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range 
of 1 to 1¼  percent.  In light of recent and ex-
pected increases in the Federal Reserve ’s non-
reserve liabilities, the Committee directs the 
Desk to continue purchasing Treasury bills at 
least into the second quarter of 2020 to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019.  
The Committee also directs the Desk to con-
tinue conducting term and overnight repur-
chase agreement operations at least through April 2020 to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of sharp in-
creases in non -reserve liabilities, and to mitigate 
the risk of money market pressures that could 
adversely affect policy implementation.   In ad-
dition, the Committee directs the Desk to con-
duct overnight reverse repurchase operations 
(and reverse repurchase operations with matur-ities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or  similar trad-
ing conventions) at an offering rate of 1.00 per-cent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for

 such operations and by a per -counterparty limit 
of $30 billion per day.  
The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve ’s holdings of Treasury 
securities and to continue reinvesting all princi-
pal payments from the Federal Reserve’ s hold-
ings of agency debt and agency mortgage -
backed securities received during each calendar 
month.   Principal payments from agency debt 
and agency mortgage -backed securities up to 
$20 billion per month will continue to be rein-vested in Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities 
outstanding; principal payments in excess of 
$20 billion per month will continue to be rein-vested in agency mortgage -backed securities.  
Small deviations from these amounts for oper-
ational reasons are acceptable.  
The Committee also directs the Desk to engage 
in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities 
transactions .” 
The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 10 :00 a.m. on March 3, 2020:   
“The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong.  However, the coronavirus poses evolv -ing risks to economic activity.  In light of these 
risks and in support of achieving its maximum 
employment and price stability goals, the Fed-
eral Open Market Committee decided today to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point, to 1 to 1 ¼ percent.  The 
Committee is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. ” 
Voting for this action:   Jerome H. Powell, John C. 
Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, Neel Kashkari, Loretta J. Mester, and Randal K. Quarles.  
Consistent with the Committee’s decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1 to 1¼ per-
cent, the Board of Governors completed on March 3, 2020, unanimous votes to lower the interest rate paid on  
required and excess reserve balances to 1.10 percent and 
to approve a ½  percentage point decrease in the primary 
credit rate to 1.75 percent, effective March  4, 2020.
